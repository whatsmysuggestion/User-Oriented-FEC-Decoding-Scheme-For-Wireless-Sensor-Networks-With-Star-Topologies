The Gil bert model (1-st order Markov chain model) and the single-multiplexer 
model are two frequently used models in the study of packet-loss processes in communicati
on networks. In this paper we investigate the accuracy of the Gilbert model, and higher-o
rder Markov chain extended Gilbert models, 
in characterizing the packet-loss process associated with a transport network modeled 
in terms of a single-multiplexer. More specifically, we quantitatively compare the packet-
loss statistics predicted by the Gilbert models
 with those predicted by an exact queueing analysis of the single-multiplexer model. 
This topic is important since low-complexity Gilbert models are frequently used to 
characterize end-to-end network packet-loss behavior. 
On the other hand, network congestion behavior is often characterized in terms of a
 single bottleneck node modeled as a multiplexer. It is of some interest then to est
ablish the relative accuracy of Gilbert models in predicting the packet-loss behavior
 on even such a simplified network model. We demonstrate that the Gilbert models have
 some serious deficiencies in accurately predicting the packet-loss statistics of the 
single-multiplexer model. The results are shown to have some serious consequences for 
the performance evaluation of forward error correction (FEC) coding schemes used to comb
at the effects of packet losses due to network buffer overflows.
