Improve performance provided this added redundancy does not adversely affect the network packet loss
characteristics.On the other hand,from the network's perspective,the widespread use of FEC schemes
by end nodes will increase the raw packet loss rate in a network because of the additional loads resulting
from transmission of redundant packets.Therefore,in order to optimize the end-to-end performance,the
appropriate tradeoff,in terms of the amount of redundancy added,and its effect on network packet-loss
processes,needs to be investigated under specific and realistic modeling assumptions.
